  ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, we are surrounded by a large number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors. These devices are designed to make life easier and more comfortable. Blockchain technology, especially its mass application, is becoming a term number one. Adoption of blockchain into enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled. Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain. The key novelty of our solution is a distributed management of configuration files of IoT devices in enterprise networks utilizing blockchain technology. This is essentially improving security and storage options for configurations in the blockchain.},

  abstract = {Remote monitoring and controlling of the sub-station equipment is an important issue for the power/energy management department which is normally done manually, or using an expensive PLC and SCADA system. With the emergence of the internet and computational era, a smart monitoring and reliable controlling system over the entire sub-station equipment is highly desirable that can be achieved by introducing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. IoT is the network of physical devices embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators and network connectivity which have the ability to identify, collect and exchange the data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system and able to interoperate within the existing internet infrastructure. This paper proposed an IoT based network strategy for monitoring and controlling the sub-station equipment so that managing time and resources can take place as efficiently as possible. The IoT based system allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit with the added merits of minimum human intervention. Moreover, a prototype system has been implemented and tested for measuring the effectiveness of the proposed model.}
