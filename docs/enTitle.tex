\en-abstract{
  Visual Question Answering is a multi-modal task under the consideration of
   both the Vision and Language communities. Present VQA models are limited 
   to classification answers and cannot provide answers for reasoning questions. 
   In this work, we introduce an encoder-decoder model using vision-and-language 
   pretrained embedding, which delivers multi-word generated sentences as answers. 
   We utilise LXMERT and VisualBERT embedding space with three different generative 
   decoder heads, including RNNs, Attention RNNs and Transformers. Extensive experiments
    show competitive performance on the FSVQA dataset through 
  qualitative and quantitative evaluation and a Human Error Analysis.
