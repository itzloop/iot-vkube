\en-abstract{
  % Visual Question Answering is a multi-modal task under the consideration of
  %  both the Vision and Language communities. Present VQA models are limited 
  %  to classification answers and cannot provide answers for reasoning questions. 
  %  In this work, we introduce an encoder-decoder model using vision-and-language 
  %  pretrained embedding, which delivers multi-word generated sentences as answers. 
  %  We utilise LXMERT and VisualBERT embedding space with three different generative 
  %  decoder heads, including RNNs, Attention RNNs and Transformers. Extensive experiments
  %   show competitive performance on the FSVQA dataset through 
  % qualitative and quantitative evaluation and a Human Error Analysis.
